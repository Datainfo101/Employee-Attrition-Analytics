---

## üö© Overview

This interactive dashboard encapsulates comprehensive insights into employee attrition across a dataset of **1,470** employees, highlighting key factors such as:

- Departments and job roles
- Job & environment satisfaction
- Tenure, income, and commute distance

**Key metric:** ~**16%** overall attrition rate

---

## üîç Key Insights

- **High-Turnover Areas**: Sales and early-career roles show elevated attrition
- **Satisfaction Correlation**: Low satisfaction scores are strong attrition predictors
- **Tenure & Pay**: Employees with ‚â§‚ÄØ5 years tenure and lower income have higher exit rates
- **Commute Distance**: No meaningful impact on attrition

---

- Identify high-risk segments (e.g., low-income, low-satisfaction new hires)
